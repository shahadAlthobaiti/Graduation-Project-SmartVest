# Smart Vest for Pain Detection using AI

🎓 **Graduation Project – Taif University**  
👩‍💻 Developed by: Shahad Althobaiti

---

## 📌 Project Overview
This project introduces a smart wearable vest designed to detect pain levels in real-time using ECG and Flex sensors. The system collects physiological data, which is then analyzed using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to determine the intensity of pain. It aims to assist physical therapy, patient monitoring, and early diagnosis.
